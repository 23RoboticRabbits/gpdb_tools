# Overview

This is an incubator for various tools to help support or work with GPDB.  They should be considered beta though I try to keep them in a usable state.  Eventually tools will be moved into their own repository or onto the main greenplum site.

## gpdb_tools

This is a collection of support tools for GPDB that are under development.  Please be careful as 
these may not be complete.

## Packcore (Python - Deprecated)
 This is a generic tool to collect core files and the necessary libraries/binaries to read them
